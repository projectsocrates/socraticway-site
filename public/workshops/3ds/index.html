# Start With Why

### [Simon Sinek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2SEPoQEgqA)

## Example Mission Statements

Amazon: Our vision is to be earthâ€™s most customer centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.

Tesla: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.

Nest: Nest's mission is to reinvent unloved but important devices in the home. https://https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html

IBM: Solutions for a smaller planet.

Apple: To make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind.

HP: See lack of mission statement and how it has affected HP's bottom line in the past few years. http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/about-hp/corporate-objectives.html

## T shaped human for better communication

The vertical bar on the T represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own.

---

## Socratic Method

---

## A question should serve 2 purposes

1. Truly help you understand the persons' opinion.
2. Direct the conversation in hopes of finding inconsistencies in statements.

---

## Finding Inconsistencies

---

# Rhetorical Devices

1. **Do:** I believe...<br />
   **Don't:** You are...<br /><br />
2. **Don't:** You should do...<br />
   **Do:** Lets...<br /><br />
3. **Don't:** Sucks/wrong/bad...<br />
   **Do:** Inconsistent with/not going to help/going to hurt [goal]...<br /><br />
4. **Don't:** I wanna build this...<br />
   **Do:** Ask: How could we...<br /><br />

# Design

# Design

## Principles
1. Design for your audience - the panelists for Sunday.
  * Focus on elements of the design that could wow the panelists, ie, don't make registration screens/login screens.
2. Design isn't just about making things look nice. It's about providing an experience that hasn't been experienced before.
3. Follow Dieter Rams [10 Principles of Good Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#Dieter_Rams:_ten_principles_for_good_design)
4. Try not to focus too much on less important things for Sunday, like logos.
5. Your goal as a designer will be to work on the overall look and feel, but really focus in on 1 specific UX experience that could set your product apart.

---
# Design

## Strategy

**Friday**

* **Midnight**: Commit to the design frameworks you want to use. Find the tools, structure, etc. Color choices are easier and can be done Sunday.

**Saturday**

* **5pm**: Have a feature you really want to design wireframed and ready to be designed. At this point you should be in constant communication with your product developer (programmer, etc) to finish this product.

**Sunday**

* **5pm**: Clean up your design. At this point any design and development should be geared towards the pitch/demo.)

---
# Design

## Tools

**Choose only 1-2 tools and learn your tools before the weekend starts**

* [Codrops](http://codrops.com)
* [Google Web Designer](http://google.com/webdesigner)
* White Board are your friend. Take photos with your phone/laptop and share them.

# Develop

---

# Develop

## Principles

1. You are developing for the panelists, not the entire app.
2. Don't build anything that's standard and isn't valuable during a demo. ie. Login and registration
  * Develop the most vague stuff first, and move from there. Ie, choose a tech stack, push to Heroku, then slowly build away..
3. Always find something to build. Idle time should be only for resting, not because you can't find something to do.
4. Things will change rapidly. You need to code in a way where you may create the really abstract functionalities.

---

# Develop

## Strategy

**Friday**

* **Midnight**: Commit to the tech stacks and frameworks you want to use. Find the tools, structure, etc. Remember to code without specificity. Market validation the next day will change things.

**Saturday**

* **5pm**: You should have functional features by now. At this point you should focus on building the 1 part of the app that you can really show off.

**Sunday**

* **5pm**: Keep running through the demo to find errors. Just make it work on 1 environment. Where you have holes, try to either use wireframes or slideshows or google web designer to fill the gaps.

---

# Develop

##Tools

* Web Deployement
    * [Heroku](http://heroku.com) -  Your app will be shown off on a different computer. Please host it in a place that's easy to get to. Heroku is free.

# Strategize

---

## Most startups fail from a lack of (paying) customers

---

## Startups are not just a small version of a big company.

---
##**Startup:**
Temporary organization used to 
search for a repeatable and scalable 
business model.

*As defined by Steve Blank.*

---

#**Lean Canvas**

---

.left.small[![lean](lean.png)]

---

* **Customers pay you:** customers buy your product. They find it. Evaluate it. Decide to purchase it, and ultimately pay for it. No customers means no business so they matter a lot.

* **Users donâ€™t:** users use your product: they register, login, push the buttons and move the pixels. They are the people who day in day out decide if they love it, hate it, or lie somewhere in between.

---

#Validate

---

# Validate

## Principle
Have general market validation: market research, percentages of market, competitive landscape, etc.

---

## Finding Insights
###**Primary Qualitative Research**

Human-centered Design - to truly create a product or service that provides significant value, we need to design and create with people, not for people 

---

## What is quantitative research?
Research used for exploration, not measurement 

* focused on subjective meaning insights
* primary method: personal interviews (consumer/expert) 

Ex: pretending to be a customer or interviewing to other customers 

* "I'm a student doing researchâ€¦" 


---

## Qualitative Tools

**Tools:** Asking Meaningful Questions 

Be deliberate in your interactions with people

**"why" questions = addresses current reality**

* requires introspection 
* this is where you find problems or satisfaction 

**"how" questions = addresses hypothetical reality**

* "could" is in the conditional mood which implies hypothetical situation
* this is where you're going to tap into people's desires and get potential features/USP 

http://www.designkit.org/methods 


---

##Finding Numbers 
###Secondary Quantitative Research

---

##What is quantitative research?
Numbers to inform and support your decisions 

* uses are endless (geographic profile, competition, consumer data, etc.)  
* panelists care about numbers
* round to the nearest whole number (stickiness factor)

---

##Typical Resources for Secondary Data 

---

## Paid-for marketing research***
UT library database is one of the most powerful weapons you have as a student entrepreneur. 

###**Tool: Mintel**

* consumer data, market sentiment, etc.
* log into Mintel from UT library portal
* create account
* filter settings to "market report"

Others: Marketline (general industry reports), Reference USA (competitive landscape)

---

## Non-profit research 

###**Tool: Pew Research**

* "Conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content analysis and other empirical social science research"

---

## Free government databases 

###**Tool: Census**
* demographics and economic trends

---
# Validate

## Strategy

**Friday**

* Have some market research done and interview questions defined to provide to use when you pitch your idea to everyone.

**Saturday**

* After doing market validation in the morning, you need to restructure your strategy to reflect the feedback you received. 

**Sunday**

* **Pitch**: Have a good amount of primary and secondary research within your pitch.
 
---

# Pitch

## **Principle**

### KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid)

---

#10 slides

* Title
* Problem
* Solution 
* Business model 
* Underlying magic
* Marketing and sales Competition
* Team
* Projections
* Status and timeline
